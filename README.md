# Supersaw - Open Source Web Based DAW

<a href="https://supersaw.app"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Try%20it%20on-Supersaw.APP-%23FADE6A.svg?style=for-the-badge"></a>

**Supersaw** is a music production tool that allows you to create music in your browser.

It is not meant to be a full-fledged DAW, or a commercial tool, or something you rely on for anything serious, it is
meant to be fun to build for developers that are interested in DSP, music production and sound stuff.

> **Open source is not a democracy, it's a gift.**
>
> Pull requests are welcome, but please keep in mind that this is a hobby project and ultimately I do what I want with
> it, if you want to fork it and do your own thing, that's cool too.
